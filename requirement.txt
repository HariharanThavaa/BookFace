In this this course work I have used express and mongodb for implementation.

Express is a framework for building web applications on top of Node.js. It simplifies the server creation process that is already available in Node. In case you were wondering, Node allows you to use JavaScript as your server-side language.

MongoDB is a database. This is the place where you store information for your web websites (or applications).

navigate downloaded folder using command prompt
cd I:\Hari\cbsd-coursework\coursework-two-programming-using-node-js-HariharanThavaa

Ensure node.js availablity by typing below command 
node -v 
if node available you will get version details as v6.11.2 else please install node.js

Once you navigate into it, run
npm init

give the name as bookface and just hit enter through everything that appears.

This command creates package.json


Now we have to install express. All you have to do is run below command
npm install express --save

Install Nodemon - Nodemon restarts the server automatically whenever you save the file
npm install nodemon --save-dev

goto Package.json file replace 
"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node server.js"
  }
  
 with
 "scripts": {
     "dev": "nodemon server.js"
  }

Install body-parser to parse the values from client to server
npm install body-parser --save

Install Mongo DB
npm install mongodb --save

In this course work I have created Mongo data base Mongo Atlas cloud repository and used it to store the data

In this course work I used Embedded Javascript as my template engine. Install ejs
npm install ejs --save

In order track user information we need npm install node-session
npm install node-session
and 
npm install client-sessions

Finally user authentication is done by the mail we need nodemailer

In order to do session management I have used the 
npm install nodemailer

Inorder to start the server run below command
npm run dev
